// to win this game : Start by guessing the middle of the range (e.g., 50 in this case).
//  This way, you quickly narrow down the possibilities.Based on the feedback (too high or too low), adjust your guess accordingly. 
//  For example, if the feedback is "too high," guess a number lower than your previous guess, and vice versa.
//  RefinE your guess based on the feedback until you correctly guess the target number or run out of attempts.
//it is generated randomly
